# The project:

Name: Attention Rehab 

Problem:

One moment I'm working, the next moment I need to look up something on Twitter/LinkedIn and the moments after that get passed in a haze as I get sucked up by the algorithmic home feed. I got tired of this!

Maybe you are too. But it's not our fault. After all, the smartest minds of an entire generation worked on creating these feeds as addictive as possible. 

That's why I created Attention Rehab, an extension to help us break free from the attention-hijacking tactics of modern websites.

It gives you:

- **Custom Blocklist**: Easily add distracting websites to your personalized block list.
- **Work Mode Toggle**: One-click activation to enter a distraction-free work environment.
- **Flexible Access Passes**: Need to check a blocked site? Use 1, 5, or 15-minute passes for controlled access.
- **Mindful Browsing**: Requires a brief justification for using access passes, promoting intentional internet use.
- **Automatic Re-blocking**: Sites are automatically blocked again when your pass expires â€“ no need to remember to turn it back on!
